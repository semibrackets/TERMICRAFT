The TERMICRAFT project

ver 0.0.0-alpha-dev (Proof of concept)
TO-DO:


FEATURES:
Mining and placing blocks: Mine with [ , ] and place with [ . ]

Blocks can be changed with the up and down arrow keys (used to be the number row but changed for future proofing)

Current blocks:

Air = [ ]
Grass = [ . ]
Dirt = [ % ]
Stone = [ # ]
Door 1 = [ | ] will let the player walk through but will count as a colliding block for the entity chasing the player
Door 2 = [ - ] same for door 1

Movement across x y and z coords (w | a | s | d | W (z up) | S (z down))

BUGS:

BUG: if the player is next to dirt block(s) '%' the player cant move. These should be treated like stone blocks '#'.
DESCRIPTION: Within the switch case function in the getInput function(), i discoved that when i was developing the collision detection for the dirt blocks I copied and pasted the part without changing it for each case. This is the cause of the weird error
FIX: Adjust each case function to check the proper zyx coords.
